# Code and Data Product Portfolio


This repository contains (links to) code and/or data products I've developed in recent years.

## Code examples



## Shiny Apps

* [**Birmingham Institute of Forest Research** (BIFoR)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/bifor/index.aspx) Data Expliration Platform:  
**link**: [https://aglhurley.shinyapps.io/bifor/](https://aglhurley.shinyapps.io/bifor/)
This in-devolopment `shiny` app is being buitl for the institute's staff as an exploration and data download portal, as well as for outreach and educational purposes. 
It was demonstrated at an outreach and education exchange workshop with members from UK higher education institutions. Ultimately, this app will feature live data, once the necessary infrastructure has been installed on-site.

## Software

### Authored:

* **lib2bib**:  
R` package to acknowledge other `R` packages. 
It allows to search for and cite all packages used in a file, directory or `RStudio` project via calls to `library()`, `require()` or using the `::` operator notation. It includes a shiny interface to select specific packages and save them to a text or `.bib` file. 
Future improvements will include the ability to supply a bibliography style file, and copying the output to the clipboard.

### Contributed:

* **RAPTOR**:  
Row and Position Tracheid Organizer in R.
`R` package for wood anatomical analyses, allowing to pre-process, filter and extract cell properties from wood thinsections, significantly simplifying the process of extracting information for further processing.
My role in this package was to refactor and re-structure code to ensure compliance with CRAN requirements and best-practices.
