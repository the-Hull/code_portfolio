# Portfolio


This repository contains (links to) code and/or data products, as well as presentations I've developed and created in recent years.

## Code examples



## Shiny Apps

* [**Birmingham Institute of Forest Research** (BIFoR)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/bifor/index.aspx) Data Expliration Platform:   
**link**: [https://aglhurley.shinyapps.io/bifor/](https://aglhurley.shinyapps.io/bifor/)  
This in-devolopment `shiny` app is being built for the institute's staff as an exploration and data download portal, as well as for outreach and educational purposes. 
It was demonstrated at an outreach and education exchange workshop with members from UK higher education institutions. Ultimately, this app will feature live data, once the necessary infrastructure has been installed on-site.

## Software

### Authored:

* **lib2bib**:  
`R` package to acknowledge other `R` packages. 
It allows to search for and cite all packages used in a file, directory or `RStudio` project via calls to `library()`, `require()` or using the `::` operator notation. It includes a shiny interface to select specific packages and save them to a text or `.bib` file. 
Future improvements will include the ability to supply a bibliography style file, and copying the output to the clipboard.

### Contributed:

* **RAPTOR**:  
Row and Position Tracheid Organizer in R.
`R` package for wood anatomical analyses, allowing to pre-process, filter and extract cell properties from wood thinsections, significantly simplifying the process of extracting information for further processing.
My role in this package was to refactor and re-structure code to ensure compliance with CRAN requirements and best-practices.

## Presentations

* **Introduction to R - project set-up, data management and coding** (2015). 
This presentation was delivered to the physical geography department during a dedicated seminar at University of Birmingham. The focus was set presenting approaches to ensure projects were set up in a coherent, machine-readable and reproducible manner.  
**links:** [slides (PDF)](/doc/presentations/Introduction-to-R.pdf)

* **Intro to project management with git, GitHub and RStudio** (2018).  
This presentation was delivered to the water science research group during a dedicated seminar at University of Birmingham and included best practices in version controlling, project set-up, reproducible workflows and live coding sessions.

* **Staying up-to date: automating tasks from downloading data to reporting** (2019).
Delivered at the European Geophysical Union General Assembly, this presentation was directed at geo-scientists looking to automate data aquisition, reporting and visualization, relying on `Rmarkdown`, `GitHub` and `TravisCI`.

* **Obtaining, cleaning and visualizing hydrological data with R** (2019).  
Delivered at the European Geophysical Union General Assembly, this presentation showcased a suite of open-source software (`R` packages) that can facilitate typical workflows while enhancing reproducibility, including downloading, processing and visualizing results.
